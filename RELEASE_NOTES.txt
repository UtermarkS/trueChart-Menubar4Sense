                     * If sorting is defined manually, the user has to define the sorting himself and, if necessary,
                       he must also specify the sorting by selection status. With this sort, the selection behavior
                       corresponds to the Qlik Sense standard.
                     * The recommendation is to define sorting by selection status for Sense Selects and
                       never for single selection (corresponds to the automatic behavior).
    * [HICO-2357] - Performance improvement: Single Selects default selections are triggered multiple times
